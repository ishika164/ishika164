## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a recent B.Tech graduate in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (2025) with a strong passion for transforming complex data into meaningful insights. My academic foundation, combined with hands-on project experience, has equipped me with practical skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel for real-world data analysis.

Throughout my graduation, I worked on multiple analytics projects involving data cleaning, pattern discovery, and dashboard creation. I enjoy exploring data, solving problems, and helping businesses make smarter, data-driven decisions.

ðŸ’» **Technical Skills**:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit)
- SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Power BI (Dashboards, DAX, Data Modeling)
- Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Formulas)
- Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Reporting

Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy exploring new places, doing artwork, and readingâ€”all of which fuel my creativity and problem-solving mindset. I also love listening to soft music, which keeps me calm, focused, and energized.
